=== Using Testnets

=== MetaMask and Testnets

MetaMask is a usefull tool for testing out dapps right in the browser. The MetaMask extension can be added to Chrome, firefox, opera, or the new [Brave browser](https://www.brave.com/). Once you have the plugin installed you can connect easily to the ethereum main, or test networks. [Image](https://github.com/MetaMask/faq/raw/master/images/click-the-test-network.png) Additionaly MetaMask protects its users by checking the sights you browse to against a blacklist of known ethereum phishing sites.

=== Getting test-ETH - Testnet Faucets

Since testnets do not operate with real money, the incentive to secure the testnets by miners is low.
Therefore, the testnets must be differently protected against abuse and attacks.
As a result, so-called faucets exist, which distribute free test ether to developers in a controlled manner.

==== Ropsten

For the Ropsten testnet, different faucets exist:

* http://faucet.ropsten.be:3001/
This faucet provides the possibility to queue the address that should receive the test ether.

* MetaMask
MetaMask offers an option to buy ether.
If the Ropsten testnet is used, this buy option will allow selecting the Ropsten Test Faucet Service.

==== Rinkeby

The Rinkeby faucet is located at https://faucet.rinkeby.io/.
To request test ether it is necessary to make a public post on either Twitter, Goole Plus or Facebook.

==== Kovan

The Kovan testnet supports various methods to request test ether.
Further information can be found in the Kovan testnet GitHub Repository located at https://github.com/kovan-testnet/faucet/blob/master/README.md.
